| eagerLoading | boolean | Whether the links should be loaded once they appear or load them only when the user clicks on them. | true |

## API Reference

### `getInstance(): MPADiff`

getInstance() returns an MPADiff object that is currently activated.
This method is helpful since MPADiff is built based on the [Singleton Design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern).
### `setDefaultLoaderDelay(delay: number): void`

Sets a number representing milliseconds before removing the loader from the DOM to avoid flashing if the content was loaded too quickly.

### `setEagerLoading(eagerLoading: boolean): void`

Sets a boolean representing whether the links should be eagerly or lazy loaded.

### `setLoader(loader?: HTMLElement|Node): void`

Sets the loader element that will be used. If `undefined` is passed, No loader will appear.
### npm/yarn

```
import MPADiff from 'MPADiff';
MPADiff.init({...opts})
const MPADiffInstance = MPADiff.getInstance();
...
```

### self-host/cdn

```
<script src="build/index.js"></script>

MPADiff.init({...opts})
const MPADiffInstance = MPADiff.getInstance();
...
```
